# React Yoga Example

A React application set up using CocoaPods.

This is an example app for the changes suggested in
[react-native#20758](https://github.com/facebook/react-native/pull/20758)

It uses YogaKit in conjunction with React Native. This was previously not
possible due to a name clash with the yoga implementation that ships with React
Native.
